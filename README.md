# Becker cover support for Home Assistant

A native home assistant component to control becker RF shutters with a Becker Centronic USB Stick.
It uses [pybecker](https://pypi.org/project/pybecker/).
The becker integration currently support to
- Open a Cover
- Close a Cover
- Stop a Cover
- Set Cover position
- Track Cover position by travel time or template
- Track commands from Becker Remote

It tracks the position by using the travel time of your cover.

It support value template if you want to use sensors to set the current state of your cover.


## Installation

Copy the different sources in custom_components folder of your HA configuration directory

## Configuration

Once installed you can add a new cover configuration in your HA configuration

```yaml
cover:
  - platform: becker
    # Optional device path (useful when running from docker container)
    # Default device:
    # "/dev/serial/by-id/usb-BECKER-ANTRIEBE_GmbH_CDC_RS232_v125_Centronic-if00"
    device: "/dev/beckercentronicusb"
    # Optional database filename (database is stored in HA config folder)
    filename: "centronic-stick.db"
    covers:
      kitchen:
        friendly_name: "Kitchen Cover"
        channel: "1"
      bedroom:
        friendly_name: "Bedroom Cover"
        # Using Unit 1 - Channel 2
        channel: "2"
        value_template: "{{ states('sensor.bedroom_sensor_value') | float > 22 }}"
      livingroom:
        friendly_name: "Living room Cover"
        # Using Unit 2 - Channel 1
        channel: "2:1"
        # Optional Travel Time to track cover position by time
        # one time is sufficient if up and down travel time is equal
        travelling_time_up: 30
        # Optional Travel Time for direction down
        travelling_time_down: 27
        # Optional Remote ID from your Becker Remote, e.g. your master sender (multiple ID's separated by comma are possible)
        # to find out the Remote ID of your Becker Remote enable debug log for becker
        remote_id: "12345:2"
```

Note: The channel and remote_id needs to be a string!

## Note

To use your cover in HA you need to pair it first with the USB stick. To pair your cover run the service becker.pair. See HA Developer Tools -> Services

```yaml
service: becker.pair
data:
  # Example data to pair your cover with USB stick unit 1 - channel 1
  channel: 1
  unit: 1
```

Of course you have to put your shutter in pairing mode before. This is generally done by holding the programming button of your master sender until you hear a "clac" noise

## Troubleshooting

If you have any trouble enable debug log for becker. Add the following lines to your configuration.yaml:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    # This must be the folder name of your /config/custom_components/hass-becker-component folder
    custom_components.hass-becker-component: debug
    # Enable debug for pybecker for more detailed information as well
    pybecker: debug
```

This enable DEBUG messages to the home-assistant.log file in your config folder.

Also helpful to find out the Remote ID of your Becker Remote. The message will be something like below every time you press a key on your Remote:

2022-02-22 19:11:43 DEBUG ... \[pybecker.becker_helper\] Received packet: **unit_id: 12345, channel: 2**, command: HALT, argument: 0, packet: b'\x020000000002010B0000000000123450210001001000\x03'

This integration was developed for my home integration. Even if I tried to make it as generic as possible, it could be that you have to adapt it a bit for your own integration.
